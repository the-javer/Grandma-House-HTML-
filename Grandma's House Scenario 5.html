            <p>Right before you walk over to your grandma you look at</p>
            <p>your doorway and she is standing there already.</p>
            <p>She offers you cookies but before you respond to her question</p>
            <p>you ask her your question about the smell. Her face loses all</p>
            <p>emotion and then you feel something poke your arm. You see a small</p>
            <p>syrince that has a pale blue liquid in it. You get dizzy and fall to</p>
            <p>the ground and right before you close your eyes you hear your grandma say</p>
            <p>"good thing I kept that cyanide".</p>
            <p>You died.</p>
