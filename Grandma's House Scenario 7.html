        <p>You leave your room and start to walk around and your grandma's house is pretty average.</p>
        <p>It has a bathroom, kitchen, dining room, bedroom and all the regular stuff until you notice</p>
        <p>a room with a closed door. You walk towards it and immediatly speed walk away from it. The funny</p>
        <p>smell is so intense at the door you almost gagged. You then hear your grandma approaching.</p>
        <p>There is a closet near by that you can hide in so you don't have to find out if exploring is against</p>
        <p>any rules your grandma has. Or you can stay in your position and find out.</p>
